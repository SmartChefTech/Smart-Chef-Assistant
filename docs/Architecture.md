# System Architecture

## Overview

The Smart Grocery & Cooking Assistant app consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Frontend**: User interface for interacting with the app.
2. **Backend**: Server-side logic and API management.
3. **Image Recognition**: Identifies ingredients and store layouts using Gemini Pro Vision or GPT-4o.
4. **Recommendation Engine**: Provides recipe and ingredient recommendations using Gemini or ChatGPT models.
5. **Data Integration**: Integrates weather API, location API, and other necessary external data sources.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: React Native
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django)
- **Image Recognition**: Gemini Pro Vision, GPT-4o
- **Recommendation Engine**: Gemini, ChatGPT
- **APIs**:
  - Weather API: For fetching current weather data.
  - Location API: For determining user location and finding nearby stores.
  - Recipe LLM: Uses large language models to provide recipe recommendations.

## Component Interaction

1. **User Interface**: Users interact with the app via a mobile interface.
2. **API Gateway**: Facilitates communication between frontend and backend, and integrates external APIs.
3. **Image Processing**: Utilizes Gemini Pro Vision or GPT-4o for ingredient and store layout recognition.
4. **Recommendation Engine**: Uses Gemini or ChatGPT models for providing personalized recipe and ingredient recommendations.
5. **Data Integration**: Manages integration with weather, location, and other necessary external data sources.

## High-Level Execution Flow

1. **User Interaction**:
   - Users interact with the app via the React Native frontend.
   - User inputs are sent to the backend via the API Gateway.

2. **Data Collection**:
   - Weather data is fetched using the Weather API.
   - User location is determined using the Location API.
   - Ingredient recognition and store layout are processed using Gemini Pro Vision or GPT-4o.

3. **Recommendation Engine**:
   - Recipe recommendations are generated using the Recipe LLM.
   - Ingredient and preparation suggestions are provided using Gemini or ChatGPT models.

4. **Data Integration**:
   - Integrates data from weather, location, and other external sources to enhance recommendations.
   - Provides real-time feedback and instructions during the cooking process.

## Key Components

1. **Frontend (React Native)**:
   - User Interface: Allows users to interact with the app, input preferences, and receive recommendations.
   - Real-Time Cooking Assistance: Displays real-time cooking instructions and feedback.

2. **Backend (Python Flask/Django)**:
   - API Gateway: Manages API requests between frontend, external APIs, and backend services.
   - Logic Layer: Implements business logic for processing user inputs and generating recommendations.

3. **Image Recognition (Gemini Pro Vision, GPT-4o)**:
   - Ingredient Identification: Recognizes and categorizes ingredients from kitchen scans.
   - Store Layout Recognition: Identifies store layouts and guides users to find ingredients.

4. **Recommendation Engine (Gemini, ChatGPT)**:
   - Recipe Recommendations: Uses LLMs to provide personalized recipe suggestions.
   - Ingredient Preparation: Provides detailed preparation steps based on recipe requirements.

5. **Data Integration**:
   - External APIs: Integrates weather, location, and other necessary data sources.
   - User Data: Collects and analyzes user preferences and feedback for improving recommendations.

This architecture leverages advanced AI models and external APIs to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly grocery shopping and cooking assistant.
